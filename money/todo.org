* TODO tag types

e.g. monthly, one-off ??

* TODO flag transactions

might be unsure of tag, say, so flag to look at later

* TODO add 'events'

maybe just a flag on a a Tag to say it's an event

* TODO sub-tags

just one level for sanity

e.g.

holiday
 - kavos
 - lake louise

beer
 - my birthday

* TODO calendar view which shows which days money was spent on a certain tag
